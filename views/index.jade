  p This is a timestamp microservice.  You can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether the string contains a unix or natural language date.  If it does, a JSON of both the unix and natural language date will be returned, as well as the day of the week for that date.  If the string is not a valid date, a JSON with values will be returned.
